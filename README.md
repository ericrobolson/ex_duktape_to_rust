This is an experiment in compiling a C program and exposing it in Rust. All credit goes to the people who wrote the Duktape library and the folks who wrote up the Rust tutorial.

Based off [this tutorial](https://liufuyang.github.io/2020/02/02/call-c-in-rust.html).

Uses [Ducktape](https://duktape.org/) as the JS engine.

Roadmap:
- [x] Get a simple "printf" function going in [this tutorial](https://liufuyang.github.io/2020/02/02/call-c-in-rust.html)
- [x] Automate the linking script in [this tutorial](https://liufuyang.github.io/2020/02/02/call-c-in-rust.html)
- [x] Automate the build script in [this tutorial](https://liufuyang.github.io/2020/02/02/call-c-in-rust.html)
- [x] Test out duktape.
